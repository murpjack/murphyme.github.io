It is a library which allows a server-side component to interact with a corresponding client-side component. SignalR uses websockets to push notifications from server to client.  </p>\n<p>Imagine two students being naughty in their teacherless classroom. (Shocking :o )  A third student acts as a lookout and shouts “teacher’s coming” only when the teacher is actually coming back, so the first and second students can keep on playing without keeping an eye on the door.</p>\n<h3>For example...</h3>\n<p>Real-world uses of the SignalR library could be a messenger app that updates when you are typing, a flight site - like Skyscanner taking bookings, or an e-commerce site, displaying different products.</p>\n<h3>Is it useful?</h3>\n<p>SignalR only talks to the client-side of a web application when it notices an update. It sends notifications in real-time. This is useful as it saves the application from fetching data from the server on a set interval (polling) and looking for any differences.</p>\n<h3>Is SignalR my only hope?</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of alternatives to Microsoft’s SignalR, some attracting favourable reviews. SocketIO is an alternative as are NodeJS, Pusher, used by Groupon, and Google’s Cloud messaging service - Pub/Sub.\nIt is worth noting SignalR.net core is a free open-source library that works on both linux and Windows and is preferable to SignalR.net, which requires a Microsoft system.\n<a href=\"https://stackshare.io/stackups/pusher-vs-signalr-vs-socket-io\">Stackshare</a> offers an overview of some popular services.</p>\n<h3>Verdict</h3>\n<h4>SocketIO</h4>\n<p>The SocketIO Api comes well documented and includes an easy-to-follow tutorial for setting up a “Hello World” chat application. The server-side logic can be written in a few different languages, including Javascript :), that are documented on their site.</p>\n<h4>SignalR</h4>\n<p>Microsoft have included in SignalR, in the ‘ASP.net core v2.2’ Github repository, a number of helpful example projects and that the SignalR documentation is relatively clear and concise.\nIt is also worth mentioning that if using SignalR for app development, there are well-supported, up-to-date libraries that work with SignalR.</p>","frontmatter":{"isArticle":true,"date":"June 19, 2019","slug":"/blog/signalr-vs-socketio","title":"SignalR vs. Socket.IO","tag":"#Webdev"},"excerpt":"SignalR is a Microsoft service for web applications.
